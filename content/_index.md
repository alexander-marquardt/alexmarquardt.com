## About this site

This site brings together technical writing focused on search, data pipelines, and distributed systems at enterprise scale. It is informed by real production systems and reflects recurring patterns, trade-offs, and architectural decisions observed across system design, deployment, and long-term operation.

The material focuses on architectural reasoning for large-scale systems. It examines the behavior of relevance models, reliability mechanisms, and ingest pipelines under real-world constraints. Attention is given to system-level decisions that influence scalability, maintainability, and long-term operational effort.

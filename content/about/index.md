## Senior Principal Architect | GenAI & Search

In my current role at Elastic, I work on GenAI and Search across real-world deployments where relevance, reliability, and performance requirements drive architectural decisions. I capture high-impact, one-off solutions and turn them into reusable assets, including patterns, middleware, tools, and delivery models. These assets reduce recurring escalations and improve how systems are designed and operated.

## From Semiconductors to Full-Stack to Distributed Systems

Earlier in my career, I worked as a core architect on FPGA architecture and placement and routing algorithms for the Stratix and Cyclone FPGA families. These platforms went on to generate cumulative product revenue exceeding $15B, and the underlying algorithms remain widely deployed in production semiconductor tooling. 

I later built a full-stack web application, owning product, frontend, backend, and operations. At its peak, it scaled to tens of thousands of unique visitors per day.

Together, these experiences helped form key mental models around algorithmic optimization, performance-critical design, and resource trade-offs under tight constraints. Those mental models now guide how I approach distributed search, performance diagnosis, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) architectures, where architectural choices can have outsized consequences.

## Scope and Perspective

I operate across engineering, product management, consulting, and architecture. My perspective is shaped by academic and applied computer engineering research, and large-scale system design under real-world conditions.

## Senior Principal Architect | GenAI & Search

In my current role at Elastic, I work on GenAI and Search in enterprise environments where relevance, reliability, and performance requirements drive architectural decisions. I capture high-impact, one-off solutions and turn them into reusable assets, including patterns, middleware, tools, and delivery models. These assets reduce recurring escalations and improve how systems are designed and operated.

## From Semiconductors to Distributed Systems

Earlier in my career, I worked as a core architect on FPGA architecture and placement and routing algorithms for the Stratix and Cyclone FPGA families. These platforms went on to generate cumulative product revenue exceeding $15B, and the underlying algorithms remain widely deployed in production semiconductor tooling.

That work established a foundation in algorithmic optimization, performance-critical design, and resource trade-offs under tight constraints. The same mental models now guide how I approach distributed search, performance diagnosis, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) architectures, where architectural decisions can have outsized consequences.

## Scope and Perspective

I operate across engineering, product management, consulting, and architecture, grounding decisions in how systems behave under real-world conditions. That perspective is shaped by academic and applied computer engineering research and large-scale system design.
